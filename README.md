# battlefield-stats
This is a visualization tool for weapon stats provided on the battlefield tracker website for Battlefield 5 with the main goal of allowing a user to compare the stats of multiple profiles against one another.

The idea came about out of interest when looking at stats on the page and seeing them be listed in a table. This makes comparing the stats of profiles rather cumbersome hence the program.
